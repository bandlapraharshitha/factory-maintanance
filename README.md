## Machinery-Demos

FacCheckAI includes demos for four types of machinery, each monitoring different parameters to ensure optimal performance:

1. **Conveyor Belt**
   - **Temperature**: Monitors the temperature of the conveyor system to prevent overheating.
   - **Vibration**: Measures vibration levels to detect misalignment or mechanical wear.
   - **Pressure**: Tracks pressure levels to ensure proper functioning of the conveyor mechanism.

2. **Robot Arm**
   - **Joint Position**: Monitors the position of joints to ensure precise movements.
   - **Angle**: Measures the angle of the arm's segments for accurate handling.
   - **Speed**: Tracks the speed of movement to optimize operational efficiency.

3. **Sealing Machine**
   - **Temperature**: Monitors the temperature during the sealing process to ensure quality seals.
   - **Sealing Pressure**: Measures the pressure applied during sealing to maintain integrity.
   - **Speed**: Tracks the speed of operation to optimize throughput.

4. **Filling Machine**
   - **Flow Rate**: Monitors the flow rate of liquids being dispensed into containers.
   - **Pressure**: Tracks pressure levels to ensure consistent filling without cavitation.
   - **Cavitation Detection**: Identifies cavitation issues that could affect filling accuracy.

These demos provide valuable insights into equipment health and performance, enabling proactive maintenance and minimizing downtime.

## Technologies Used
### Backend
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for building the backend server.
- **Express.js**: Framework for creating RESTful APIs.
- **WebSocket**: For real-time communication between the server and the frontend.

### Frontend
- **React.js**: Framework for building the user interface.
- **Chart.js/Plotly.js**: Libraries for data visualization.
  
### Database
- **MongoDB**: For storing historical data and alerts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)
- **MongoDB** (if database integration is required)

---

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the backend directory:
cd backend

text
2. Install dependencies:
npm install

text
3. Start the backend server:
node server.js

text
4. The backend will run on `http://localhost:5069`.

---

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd frontend

text
2. Install dependencies:
npm install

text
3. Start the development server:
npm run dev

text
4. The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`.

---

## Usage
1. Start both the backend and frontend servers as described above.
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` to access the dashboard.
3. Use the dashboard to monitor real-time data, view anomaly detection charts, and receive notifications about potential failures.
